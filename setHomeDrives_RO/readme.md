### Scripts to find a user directory on a network share and set the share to read-only

getFolderPaths.ps1 - Export all the paths to a file to be used by setROperId.ps1.  The paths were exported to a file to improve the performance.  Ultimately, never implemented in production due to change in leadership direction. 
getHomePerms.ps1 - Return the permissions of the network directories based on the list of users.
LocateUserDrive.ps1 - Find the UNC path of a specific user ID, and return the path.
setROperID_runspaces.ps1 - Testing version of a script to set user network shares to Read-only using runspaces.  Developed due to the latency of development across the VPN.  Performance was significanltly better on the VPN; when running from the datacenter, the performance was significant enough to warrant the additional complexity for a non-programming team.
setRoperId.ps1 - Pulls the network share of a user from a file, generated by getFolderPaths.ps1, then uses icacls to save the ACLs and set the user permissions to read-only.
